#decrypto

This program is created to help solving [cryptograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram).
Because this is just a skeleton at this moment it may not be trivial to use this program. Read `'Usage'`
___
## Usage
Enter encrypted phrase in the (long) text field and hit `enter`. This will generate dashes in output field. Use only lower case letters ([for now](https://github.com/alexlcs/decrypto/issues/3)). 
Choose which letter you want to modify, type replacement letter in box next to it (only first character will be read) and again hit `enter`. That will replace input's letters with your new letter and show changes in the ouput text field. Solve the cryptogram.
